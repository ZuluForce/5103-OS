Build Instructions
==================
	$ make all
		- Builds consumer, producer and the module

	$ make clean
		- Cleans out the module, its build files, and the producer/consumer

	$ make producer/consumer
		- Build just the producer/consumer respectively

	The python load and unload scripts have not been modified.


Module Parameters
=================
	scull_size
		Param Type: int
		- The scull size represents the number of items the scullBuffer should hold.
		It does not change the size of the items (512 bytes) in any way.

	scull_major
		Param Type: int
		- You can pass in your own major number of the device but it should be left
		as 0 for dynamic allocation.

	scull_minor
		Param Type: int
		- Similarly, it should just be left to its default 0.

	In order to pass these to the scullBuffer module just add the given key=value pair along
	with the load script. ie. "sudo ./load.py scull_size=10" to create a scullBuffer device
	that can hold 10 items.



Implementation
==============

Internally the scullBuffer uses an array of 'item' structs. Each item struct
holds a size referencing how much of the data in the item's 512 byte buffer
is user data.

Items(data) are added and removed from this array in a ring buffer method. The
size of the scullBuffer's interal item array can be set at load time but it
defaults to 64. Because we are using a fixed struct array for simplicity, even
if many items are written that are less than 512 bytes the scullBuffer will still
hold a maximum of 64 (or w/e was specified) items.

	Producer
	========
		The producer is highly randomized so we could test many various
		usage scenarios. There is a fair amount of documentation within
		the source file for reference.

	Consumer
	========
		The consumer simply makes a request for the max 512 byte item and
		whatever it recieves it simply prints out. Since the first 1 or 2
		bytes of the data is the producerID it extracts this and prints it
		along with the message.

	- Both the producer and consumer will run indefinitely but they can be killed
	cleanly with Ctrl+C given their signal handlers.

	- Producers will wait some random amount of time from 100ms to 1 second before trying to write again.
	Consumers on the other hand will read as fast as possible. Whenever a producer or consumer
	receives a 0 response from their respective system calls they block for	4 seconds before retrying the
	call. Because of this it will likely happen that even with many producers and consumers running you
	will see everyone simultaneously waiting.
