In this test case we are showing how approx LRU can be worse than pure LRU and FIFO.

Frames: 3

---Access Pattern---
Process 1: A, B, C

*Process switch*

Process 2: D, E, F



Before the first process switch, we have A, B, and C in cache, each with decreasing "age".

When we are executing the second process, we replace A from Process 1 with D from Process 2. Process 2 has to wait for I/O, so we switch back to Process 1. Process 1 will be
missing a page (A) and page fault.


This scenario only exists in approx LRU and not pure LRU because the "age" is only updated when pages put into memory, not after every access.
