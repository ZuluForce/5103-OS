Description of the BadLRU test

Look at how each of the page replacement algorithms works.

FIFO - replaces pages in a first in first out order.

LRU (pure) - replaces the page that was least recently used. Time stamp is updated after every access to the page.

LRU (approx) - replaces the page that was least recently used. Time stamp is updated only when the page comes into memory.


Looking at how the test works.

The BadLRU test is a scenario where approx LRU performs worse than pure LRU and FIFO.


------------------------------------------------
Going to give a more concise description

In this test we show how approx LRU performs worse than pure LRU and FIFO. In approx LRU pages are given an age only when they are put into memory.
When switching to a different process, we do differentiate which pages were from which processes. That means that pages from a process that is not running will be considered 
old and will be replaced. When the operating system switches back to the other process there will be many page faults getting all of the replaced pages back into memory. 
Since pure LRU updates the age after every page access, it knows that the pages from the other process may not be the correct pages to be replaced.
