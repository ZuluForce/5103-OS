In this test case we are showing how LRU, both pure and approx, can be worse than FIFO.

Access pattern: 0x0, 0x1000, 0x0, 0x2000

Let's look at what the LRU and FIFO caches look like before we make another access.

LRU contains "0x0, 0x2000" and FIFO contains "0x1000, 0x2000". If the next page access is a "0x1000", LRU will page fault and therefore perform worse than FIFO. If the next page
access is an "0x0", then LRU will perform better. If the next page access is a "0x2000", they will perform equally as well. In our test the next access is "B", showing that
LRU can be worse than FIFO is some cases.
